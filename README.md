/************\*\*\*************C**************\*\*\***************/
C has had a huge influence on modern-day programming languages,
Many of which borrow heavily from it.

C++: Includes all the features of C, but adds classes and other
features to support object-oriented programming.
Java: Java is based on C++ and therefore inherits many C features.
C#: It's derived from C++ and Java.
Perl: Originally fairly simple scripting language; overtime it has
grown and adopted my of the features of C.

/**Strengths and weaknesses of C**/
Like any other programming language, C has strengths and weaknesses.

\*) C is a low-level language. To serve as a suitable language for
systems programming, C provides access to machine-level concepts(bytes and addresses, for example) that other programming languages try to hide. C also provides provides operations that correspond
closely to a computer's built-in instructions, so that programs can be fast. Sinceapplication programs rely on it for input/output,
storage management and numerous other services, an operating system
can't afford to be slow.

\*) C is small language. C provides a more limited set of features than many languages. To keep the number of features small, C relies heavily on a "library" of standard functions.

\*)C is a premissive language. C assumes that you know what you're doing, so it allows you a wider degree of latitude than many languages. Moreover, C doesn't mandate the detailed error-checking found in other languages.

/**Strengths**/
_)Efficiency
_)Portability
_)Power
_)Flexibility
_)Standary library
_)Integration with UNIX

/**Weakness**/
_)C programs can be error-prone
_)C programs can be difficult to understand.
\*)C programs can be difficult to modify.

/**Effective Use of C**/
_)Learn how to avoid C pitfalls.
_)Use software tools to make programs more reliable.
_)Take advantage of existing code libraries.
_)Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions.
_)Avoid "tricks" and overly complex code.
_)Stick to the standard.
